# Smart eBay Seller Workflow – Powered by AI & Structure

This repository documents a personal project focused on building a scalable, efficient, and intelligent eBay selling workflow.  
The goal is not just to sell physical goods, but to demonstrate how individuals can leverage **AI tools, automation, and operational structure** to build a self-sustaining global commerce system.

## 🌐 Purpose

While many use eBay as a casual marketplace, this project explores how the platform can be:
- A **sandbox for AI-assisted automation**
- A case study in **cross-border logistics and risk management**
- A real-world model of **individual-driven, micro-scale digital commerce**

---

## 🔧 Features (Phase 1: Operational Base)

- Inventory management and price tracking using CSV and Google Sheets
- AI-assisted product title and description generation
- Optional Slack & GAS (Google Apps Script) based notification system
- Weekly logging of workflow using TIL (Today I Learned) methodology
- Minimalist, low-burn-rate operation (1–5 items per week)

---

## 🔁 Upcoming Features (Phase 2: Intelligence Layer)

- 📦 **Live competitor tracking via eBay API**  
  → Automatically detect similar listings, conditions, and prices  
- 📉 **Repricing engine based on configurable strategy**  
  → Ex: Undercut lowest price by 5%, or follow median trends  
- 🧠 **Sales performance tracking & decision support**  
  → Sell-through rate analysis, top-performing categories  
- 🛡️ **Security-aware architecture**  
  → OAuth token handling, sandbox separation, audit-friendly logging

---

## 📈 Goals

- Build a repeatable structure that allows sustainable selling with minimum effort
- Share insights for developers, tech freelancers, and security-minded operators
- Demonstrate how non-scaled businesses can still deliver structured, meaningful outcomes
- Serve as a live case study that connects *past experience, current tools, and future direction*

---

## 📁 Structure

- `inventory.csv`: Product list with estimated pricing and management data
- `README.md`: Project outline and public-facing documentation
- `scripts/`: (Optional) Automation scripts for data parsing, uploading, or price updates
- `docs/`: (Optional) Published logs, user guides, and system notes
- `images/`: (Optional) Product photo archive

## 🧠 Project Vision (Memo)

This system will be developed with three key principles in mind:

- **Beautiful**: Clean structure and sustainable logic, not ad hoc scripts  
- **Smart**: Assisted by AI, automated where possible, manually overrideable  
- **Secure & Human-Friendly**: Built with minimal friction, friendly to solo sellers and security-aware users

The ultimate goal is not to maximize revenue, but to **prove that individuals can design systems that are both effective and elegant** — powered by automation, but grounded in experience.

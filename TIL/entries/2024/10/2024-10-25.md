### Windows fundamentals 2

  - lusrmgr.msc (Local Users and Groups Manager):
    - Used to manage local users and groups on a Windows machine.
    - Allows you to add, remove, and modify user accounts and groups.
    - Can be used to assign permissions and roles to users.
  
  - Control Panel:
    - A centralized place for managing system settings in Windows.
    - Allows users to configure hardware, software, user accounts, system security, and other system preferences.
    - Contains tools for managing network settings, adding/removing programs, and customizing appearance.




  - System Configuration Utility (MSConfig) is a tool primarily used for advanced troubleshooting and diagnosing startup issues on Windows systems. It requires local administrator rights to access and has the following five tabs:

    - General: Allows you to select what devices and services to load at startup (Normal, Diagnostic, or Selective startup).

    - Boot: Configures boot options for the operating system.
    
    - Services: Lists all system services, regardless of whether they are running or stopped.
    
    - Startup: Directs users to Task Manager to manage startup items (MSConfig is not a startup manager).
    
    - Tools: Provides a list of system utilities and tools for further OS configuration, with descriptions for each tool.
    
    - Commands:
    Windows Troubleshooting Command:
    C:\Windows\System32\control.exe /name Microsoft.Troubleshooting

    Control Panel Command:
    control.exe

#### Computer Management:

  - Computer Management is a utility that provides access to various system tools. The utility is divided into three main sections:
    
    - System Tools: Includes Task Scheduler, Event Viewer, Shared Folders, Local Users and Groups, Performance, and Device Manager.
    
    - Task Scheduler: Automates tasks, such as running programs or scripts at specific times or intervals.
    
    - Event Viewer: Displays logs of system events (errors, warnings, etc.) and can help diagnose problems or track actions.
    
    - Shared Folders: Lists shared folders on the system and who is currently connected to them.
    Local Users and Groups: Manages users and groups (as seen in lusrmgr.msc).
    
    - Performance Monitor (perfmon): Allows real-time performance monitoring and logging.
    
    - Device Manager: Lets users configure or disable hardware components.
    Storage: Includes Disk Management, which lets you manage disk partitions, assign drive letters, etc.
    
    - Services and Applications: Manages background services and includes WMI Control for configuring Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), used for remote and local system management.
    
    - Questions:
      - Command to open Computer Management: compmgmt.msc
      - Open Task Scheduler:
      Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog box, type taskschd.msc, and hit Enter.

    - To check the hidden folder that is shared in Windows, you can use the Computer Management tool. Here's how you can do it:

    Open Computer Management:

    - Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog box, type compmgmt.msc, and hit Enter.
    
    - Navigate to Shared Folders:
    In the left pane, under System Tools, expand Shared Folders and click on Shares.
    
    - View the List of Shared Folders:
    In the middle pane, you'll see a list of shared folders, including hidden shares.
    Hidden shared folders usually end with a $ (e.g., C$, ADMIN$), which indicates they are hidden.
    
    - Identify the Hidden Share:
    Look for folders with names ending in $ to find the hidden shares.

### Windows Fundamental 3

#### Windows Updates
  - You can access Windows Update through the Run dialog box or Command Prompt by entering the following command:
    control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate

#### Windows Security

#### Virus & threat protection

#### Firewall & Network Protection
Tip: Command to open the Windows Defender Firewall is WF.msc. 

#### App & Browser Control

#### Device Security
What is the Trusted Platform Module (TPM)?

Per Microsoft, "Trusted Platform Module (TPM) technology is designed to provide hardware-based, security-related functions. A TPM chip is a secure crypto-processor that is designed to carry out cryptographic operations. The chip includes multiple physical security mechanisms to make it tamper-resistant, and malicious software is unable to tamper with the security functions of the TPM".

#### BitLocker
  BitLocker is a data protection feature developed by Microsoft to safeguard data from theft or exposure, especially in cases where a computer is lost, stolen, or improperly decommissioned.

  - Key points about BitLocker:

    - Encrypts entire drives: BitLocker encrypts the contents of entire hard drives to protect sensitive information.
    
    - TPM (Trusted Platform Module) integration: BitLocker provides optimal security when used with a TPM, a hardware component found in many newer computers. TPM ensures the integrity of the system and prevents tampering while the system is offline.
   
    - Protection from unauthorized access: Even if the drive is removed, BitLocker ensures that the data remains inaccessible without proper decryption.
   
    BitLocker is not available on all systems, and devices without TPM may have reduced protection.

  What must a user insert on computers that DO NOT have a TPM version 1.2 or later?
  USB startup key

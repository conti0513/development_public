### Windows fundamentals 2

  - lusrmgr.msc (Local Users and Groups Manager):
    - Used to manage local users and groups on a Windows machine.
    - Allows you to add, remove, and modify user accounts and groups.
    - Can be used to assign permissions and roles to users.
  
  - Control Panel:
    - A centralized place for managing system settings in Windows.
    - Allows users to configure hardware, software, user accounts, system security, and other system preferences.
    - Contains tools for managing network settings, adding/removing programs, and customizing appearance.




  - System Configuration Utility (MSConfig) is a tool primarily used for advanced troubleshooting and diagnosing startup issues on Windows systems. It requires local administrator rights to access and has the following five tabs:

    - General: Allows you to select what devices and services to load at startup (Normal, Diagnostic, or Selective startup).

    - Boot: Configures boot options for the operating system.
    
    - Services: Lists all system services, regardless of whether they are running or stopped.
    
    - Startup: Directs users to Task Manager to manage startup items (MSConfig is not a startup manager).
    
    - Tools: Provides a list of system utilities and tools for further OS configuration, with descriptions for each tool.
    
    - Commands:
    Windows Troubleshooting Command:
    C:\Windows\System32\control.exe /name Microsoft.Troubleshooting

    Control Panel Command:
    control.exe

  - Computer Management is a utility that provides access to various system tools. The utility is divided into three main sections:
    
    - System Tools: Includes Task Scheduler, Event Viewer, Shared Folders, Local Users and Groups, Performance, and Device Manager.
    
    - Task Scheduler: Automates tasks, such as running programs or scripts at specific times or intervals.
    
    - Event Viewer: Displays logs of system events (errors, warnings, etc.) and can help diagnose problems or track actions.
    
    - Shared Folders: Lists shared folders on the system and who is currently connected to them.
    Local Users and Groups: Manages users and groups (as seen in lusrmgr.msc).
    
    - Performance Monitor (perfmon): Allows real-time performance monitoring and logging.
    
    - Device Manager: Lets users configure or disable hardware components.
    Storage: Includes Disk Management, which lets you manage disk partitions, assign drive letters, etc.
    
    - Services and Applications: Manages background services and includes WMI Control for configuring Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), used for remote and local system management.
    
    - Questions:
      - Command to open Computer Management: compmgmt.msc
      - Open Task Scheduler:
      Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog box, type taskschd.msc, and hit Enter.

    - To check the hidden folder that is shared in Windows, you can use the Computer Management tool. Here's how you can do it:

    Open Computer Management:

    - Press Windows + R to open the Run dialog box, type compmgmt.msc, and hit Enter.
    
    - Navigate to Shared Folders:
    In the left pane, under System Tools, expand Shared Folders and click on Shares.
    
    - View the List of Shared Folders:
    In the middle pane, you'll see a list of shared folders, including hidden shares.
    Hidden shared folders usually end with a $ (e.g., C$, ADMIN$), which indicates they are hidden.
    
    - Identify the Hidden Share:
    Look for folders with names ending in $ to find the hidden shares.

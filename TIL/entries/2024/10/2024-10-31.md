#### Device Security
What is the Trusted Platform Module (TPM)?

Per Microsoft, "Trusted Platform Module (TPM) technology is designed to provide hardware-based, security-related functions. A TPM chip is a secure crypto-processor that is designed to carry out cryptographic operations. The chip includes multiple physical security mechanisms to make it tamper-resistant, and malicious software is unable to tamper with the security functions of the TPM".

#### BitLocker
  BitLocker is a data protection feature developed by Microsoft to safeguard data from theft or exposure, especially in cases where a computer is lost, stolen, or improperly decommissioned.

  - Key points about BitLocker:

    - Encrypts entire drives: BitLocker encrypts the contents of entire hard drives to protect sensitive information.
    
    - TPM (Trusted Platform Module) integration: BitLocker provides optimal security when used with a TPM, a hardware component found in many newer computers. TPM ensures the integrity of the system and prevents tampering while the system is offline.
   
    - Protection from unauthorized access: Even if the drive is removed, BitLocker ensures that the data remains inaccessible without proper decryption.
   
    BitLocker is not available on all systems, and devices without TPM may have reduced protection.

  What must a user insert on computers that DO NOT have a TPM version 1.2 or later?
  USB startup key

#### Search Engines

  - Summary: Search Engines and Advanced Search Operators
    Every Internet user has used a search engine, but not everyone utilizes its full potential. Most search engines, like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, offer advanced search operators that help refine and target searches more effectively. Below are some key operators supported by Google:

    1 "exact phrase": Using double quotes around a phrase ensures that the search results contain that exact phrase.
    Example: "passive reconnaissance" retrieves pages with this exact term.

    2 site:: Limits the search to a specific domain.
    Example: site:tryhackme.com success stories only shows results from the TryHackMe website.

    3 - (minus sign): Excludes specific words from the search results.
    Example: pyramids -tourism filters out results that include the word "tourism."

    4 filetype:: Searches for specific file types such as PDFs, DOCs, PPTs, and XLS files.
    Example: filetype:ppt cyber security will find PowerPoint presentations related to cyber security.

    For more advanced search techniques, you can explore the list of search operators supported by your preferred search engine.

  - Example Questions and Answers:
    - How would you limit your Google search to PDF files containing the terms cyber warfare report?
    Answer format: filetype:pdf cyber warfare report

    - What phrase does the Linux command ss stand for?
    Answer format: socket statistics

#### Specialized Search Engines
  - While general Internet search engines are common, specialized search engines are designed to find specific types of results. Here are some examples:

  - Shodan:
    - A search engine for devices connected to the Internet, such as servers, routers, and IoT devices.
    - Useful for finding specific types and versions of servers and observing their distribution globally.
    - Example: Searching for apache 2.4.1 shows servers running that version and where they are located.
    - Additional Features: Shodan trends for historical data (subscription required).
  
  - Censys:
    - Similar to Shodan but focuses more on Internet-connected hosts, websites, certificates, and other Internet assets.
    - Use cases include enumerating domains, auditing open ports/services, and discovering rogue assets.
    - Useful for deeper insights into Internet infrastructure.
  
  - VirusTotal:
    - An online virus-scanning service that checks files or URLs against multiple antivirus engines.
    - Users can upload files, provide URLs, or enter file hashes to see if they have been flagged by antivirus programs.
    - Community comments help explain flagged files and can provide more context if a detection might be a false positive.
  
  - Have I Been Pwned (HIBP):
    - A service that checks if an email address has appeared in any data breaches.
    - Alerts users if their information (especially passwords) has been exposed in a breach.
    Highlights the risks of using the same password across multiple platforms.


  - Question: What is the top country with lighttpd servers?

    - Answer: United States
    - Explanation: The top country hosting lighttpd servers can be determined using Shodan, a specialized search engine for Internet-connected devices. By searching for lighttpd, Shodan provides data on where these servers are located and their distribution across various countries. In this case, the United States has the highest number of lighttpd servers.
    
    
  - Question: What does BitDefenderFalx detect the file with the hash 2de70ca737c1f4602517c555ddd54165432cf231ffc0e21fb2e23b9dd14e7fb4 as?

    - Answer: Android.Riskware.Agent.LHH
    - Explanation: This detection can be verified using VirusTotal, a service that scans files or URLs using multiple antivirus engines. By entering the specific file hash, VirusTotal shows how different antivirus programs classify the file. In this case, BitDefenderFalx detects it as Android.Riskware.Agent.LHH, indicating a type of riskware related to Android systems.

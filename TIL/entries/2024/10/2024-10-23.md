  - lusrmgr.msc (Local Users and Groups Manager):
    - Used to manage local users and groups on a Windows machine.
    - Allows you to add, remove, and modify user accounts and groups.
    - Can be used to assign permissions and roles to users.
  
  - Control Panel:
    - A centralized place for managing system settings in Windows.
    - Allows users to configure hardware, software, user accounts, system security, and other system preferences.
    - Contains tools for managing network settings, adding/removing programs, and customizing appearance.




  - System Configuration Utility (MSConfig) is a tool primarily used for advanced troubleshooting and diagnosing startup issues on Windows systems. It requires local administrator rights to access and has the following five tabs:

    - General: Allows you to select what devices and services to load at startup (Normal, Diagnostic, or Selective startup).
    - Boot: Configures boot options for the operating system.
    Services: Lists all system services, regardless of whether they are running or stopped.
    Startup: Directs users to Task Manager to manage startup items (MSConfig is not a startup manager).
    Tools: Provides a list of system utilities and tools for further OS configuration, with descriptions for each tool.
    Commands:
    Windows Troubleshooting Command:
    C:\Windows\System32\control.exe /name Microsoft.Troubleshooting

    Control Panel Command:

### Networking Fundamentals > Packets and Frames
  - What are Packets and Frames
  - TCP/IP(The Three-Way Handshake)
  - UDP/IP
  - Ports 101
---


#### Packet and Frames
  - Packet: Contains IP addresses, used at Layer 3 (Network Layer).
  - Frame: No IP addresses, used at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer).
  - Encapsulation: Wrapping data with layers of information (like an envelope inside another).
  - Efficiency: Sending data in small packets prevents network congestion.

  - Packet Headers:
    - Time to Live (TTL): Limits packet lifespan.
    - Checksum: Ensures data integrity.
    - Source Address: Sender's IP.
    - Destination Address: Receiver's IP.

  - Summary:
    - Packet = IP info.
    - Frame = No IP info.
---


#### TCP/IP(The Three-Way Handshake)
  - TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
    - TCP/IP Model: Four layers—Application, Transport, Internet, and Network Interface—a simplified version of the OSI model.
    - Encapsulation: Adds information as data passes through layers, and removes it at the destination.
    - Connection-based: Establishes a connection before sending data, ensuring data integrity.
    - Three-way handshake: The process to establish a reliable connection.

  - Pros and Cons:
    - Advantages: Guarantees data integrity, synchronizes devices, ensures reliability.
    - Disadvantages: Requires reliable connections, slower than UDP, prone to bottlenecks with slow connections.


  - TCP packet headers and handshake process
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Header               | Description                                   |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
| Source Port          | Port opened by sender (random 0-65535)        |
| Destination Port     | Port on remote host (e.g., webserver on 80)   |
| Source IP            | IP address of the sending device              |
| Destination IP       | IP address of the receiving device            |
| Sequence Number      | Random number for first data piece            |
| Acknowledgement Num  | Next data's sequence number + 1               |
| Checksum             | Ensures data integrity through math check     |
| Data                 | The actual transmitted data (bytes)           |
| Flag                 | Determines how the packet should be handled   |
+----------------------+-----------------------------------------------+

  - Three-way handshake
+----+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| #  | Message   | Description                                         |
+----+-----------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 1  | SYN       | Client sends to initiate a connection               |
| 2  | SYN/ACK   | Server acknowledges the client's SYN message        |
| 3  | ACK       | Acknowledges that messages have been received       |
| 4  | DATA      | Sends actual data after connection is established   |
| 5  | FIN       | Cleanly closes the connection                       |
| #  | RST       | Abruptly ends communication due to an issue         |

#### UDP/IP 
  - Advantages and Disadvantages of UDP
+----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| Advantages of UDP                            | Disadvantages of UDP                            |
+----------------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------+
| UDP is much faster than TCP.                 | UDP doesn't care if the data is received or not.|
| UDP gives control over packet send rate.     | Flexible, but can result in poor connections.   |
| UDP doesn't reserve a continuous connection. | Unstable connections result in bad user experience.|
| No connection setup required (faster start). | No safeguards like data integrity in TCP.       |

+---------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Time to Live (TTL)  | Sets an expiry timer to prevent packets from clogging up.|
| Source Address      | The IP address of the sender's device.                  |
| Destination Address | The IP address of the receiving device.                 |
| Source Port         | The port opened by the sender (randomly chosen).        |

#### a brief explanation of **ports** in networking:

- A **port** is a virtual point where network connections start and end.
- Ports help direct data to the correct program or service on a device.
- Each port is identified by a unique number (0-65535).
- Ports are associated with IP addresses to manage traffic.
- **Well-known ports** (0-1023) are reserved for common services (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
- **Registered ports** (1024-49151) are used for specific applications.
- **Dynamic/Private ports** (49152-65535) are used for temporary communication.

Ports act like doors through which data enters and leaves a device on a network.

#### Introduction to Port Forwarding
  - Port forwarding allows applications and services to connect to the internet from within a private network.
  - Without port forwarding, services (e.g., web servers) are only accessible within the local network.
  - The router opens specific ports to allow external devices to access internal services.

#### Firewalls 101

**Concepts**
  - Stateful Firewall:
    - Inspects the entire connection, not just individual packets.
    - Makes dynamic decisions based on connection behavior.
    - Uses more resources than stateless firewalls.
    - Can block an entire device if the connection is bad.

  - Stateless Firewall:
    - Uses static rules to evaluate each packet separately.
    - Less resource-intensive, but less intelligent.
    - Only effective as the rules defined in it.
    - Good for handling large traffic (e.g., DDoS attacks).

  - Firewalls work at Layer 3 (Network) and Layer 4 (Transport).


#### VPN Basics

 - Benefits of VPN
    Connects geographically distant networks:
      Allows businesses with multiple offices to share resources (e.g., servers) across locations.

    Offers privacy:
      Encrypts data, making it unreadable to anyone except the sender and recipient.
      Useful in public Wi-Fi environments to prevent data sniffing.

    Provides anonymity:
      journalists and activists rely on VPNs in countries with restricted freedom of speech.
      VPNs hide your traffic from ISPs and intermediaries, but privacy depends on whether the VPN logs user data.

 - VPN Technologies
    PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):
      Used for authentication and encryption (like SSH keys).
      Not routable on its own (cannot leave the network without help).

    PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol):
      Enables PPP data to travel between networks.
      Easy to set up but offers weaker encryption.

    IPSec (Internet Protocol Security):
      Encrypts data using the IP framework.
      More difficult to set up but provides strong encryption and wide device support.



#### LAN Networking Devices

  Router:
    - A **router** connects networks and directs data between them (**routing**).
    - Operates at **Layer 3** of the OSI model.
    - Decides paths based on factors like shortest, most reliable, or fastest routes.
    - Configurable for tasks like port forwarding and firewalling.

  Switch:
    - A **switch** connects multiple devices within a network. 
    - **Layer 2 switches** forward data using MAC addresses.
    - **Layer 3 switches** can route packets like a router using IP addresses.
    - **VLANs** separate devices virtually for added security.

  Key Terms:
    - **Routing**: Action done by a router.
    - **Layers**: Switches work at **Layer 2** and **Layer 3**.

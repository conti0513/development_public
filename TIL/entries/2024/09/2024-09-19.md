  - HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): The protocol used to communicate with web servers and transmit webpage data (HTML, images, videos, etc.), developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989-1991.

  - HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure): The secure version of HTTP, where data is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping and verify that you're communicating with the correct server.

  - Key Questions:
  What does HTTP stand for? : HyperText Transfer Protocol
  
  - What does the "S" in HTTPS stand for? : Secure

#### Requests And Responses

  - What is a URL? (Uniform Resource Locator)
    - A URL is an instruction for accessing resources on the internet. It includes:
      - **Scheme**: The protocol (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS). 
      - **User**: Optional login credentials.
      - **Host**: Domain name or IP address.
      - **Port**: The connection port (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS).
      - **Path**: The location of the resource.
      - **Query String**: Extra data sent to the resource (e.g., `/blog?id=1`).
      - **Fragment**: Refers to a specific part of the page.

  - Making a Request
    - A typical **HTTP request** example:
  
  ```bash
  GET / HTTP/1.1
  Host: tryhackme.com
  User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/87.0
  Referer: https://tryhackme.com/
  ```
    - **GET / HTTP/1.1**: Requests the homepage using HTTP version 1.1.
    - **Host**: The website (e.g., tryhackme.com).
    - **User-Agent**: Browser info (e.g., Firefox version 87).
    - **Referer**: The webpage that referred you (e.g., https://tryhackme.com).
    - Requests always end with a blank line to signal completion.

  - Example Response

```bash
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.15.8
Date: Fri, 09 Apr 2021 13:34:03 GMT
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 98
<html>...</html>
```
    - **HTTP/1.1 200 OK**: The server's protocol and status code (200 = success).
    - **Server**: Tells the client the web server software (e.g., nginx).
    - **Date**: The current date and time on the server.
    - **Content-Type**: The type of data being sent (e.g., HTML).
    - **Content-Length**: How much data is in the response.
    - A blank line confirms the end of the response.

  - **Key Questions**:
    - What HTTP protocol is being used? **HTTP/1.1**
    - What response header tells the browser how much data to expect? **Content-Length**

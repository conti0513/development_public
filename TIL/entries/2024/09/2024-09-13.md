#### arp protocol
the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) process between a device and another device on the network:

```
Device A                    Device B
   |                               |
   | ------ ARP Request -------->  |
   |   "Who has 192.168.10.2?"     |
   |                               |
   | <--- ARP Reply (MAC Address)  |
   |   "192.168.10.2 is at xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx"
   |                               |
```

##### Explanation:
1. Device A (which has the IP 192.168.10.1) sends an ARP Request to find the MAC address of Device B with IP 192.168.10.2.
2. Device B responds with an ARP Reply, providing its MAC address (shown as xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx) to Device A.



#### DHCP process

Device                         DHCP Server
   |                                |
   | ------ Discover  -------->     |
   |                                |
   | <------ Offer (192.168.10.1) - |
   |                                |
   | ------ Request (192.168.10.1) >|
   |                                |
   | <------ ACK ---------------    |
   |                                |

This diagram illustrates the standard 4-step DHCP process:

1. Discover: The device sends a broadcast message to find a DHCP server.
2. Offer: The DHCP server replies with an offer of an IP address.
3. Request: The device requests to use the offered IP address.
4. ACK: The DHCP server confirms and assigns the IP address to the device.

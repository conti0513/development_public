##### Introducing LAN Topologies
  - Star Topology:
    - Devices connect to a central device (like a switch).
    - Advantages: Reliable and easy to scale.
    - Disadvantages: Expensive to set up, relies on central device; if it fails, all devices lose connection.

  - Bus Topology:
    - Devices share a single backbone cable.
    - Advantages: Cost-effective and easy to set up.
    - Disadvantages: Prone to bottlenecks and difficult to troubleshoot. Single point of failure (if backbone cable breaks, the network goes down).

  - Ring Topology:
    - Devices are connected in a loop.
    - Advantages: Easy to troubleshoot, less prone to traffic bottlenecks.
    - Disadvantages: Inefficient data travel, single point of failure if a device or cable breaks.

  - Key Devices:
    - Switch: Connects multiple devices and directs data to the correct destination.
    - Router: Connects networks and routes data between them.

  - Key Terms:
    - LAN stands for Local Area Network.
    - Routing is the job that routers perform.
    - Switch connects multiple devices on a local network.
    - Bus Topology is cost-efficient to set up.
    - Star Topology is more expensive to set up and maintain.

##### A Primer on Subnetting
  - Subnetting Overview
    - Subnetting: The process of dividing a larger network into smaller, more manageable networks (subnets).
    - Think of it like cutting a cake into slices: you decide who gets what portion of the network.
  - IP Address Components:
    - Network Address: Identifies the start of the network (e.g., 192.168.1.0).
    - Host Address: Identifies individual devices within the network (e.g., 192.168.1.100).
    - Default Gateway: The device responsible for sending data to other networks (e.g., 192.168.1.254).

  - Subnet Mask:
    - A subnet mask is used to define how many hosts a network can have.
    - It’s made of four bytes (32 bits) and ranges from 0 to 255.
 
  - Benefits of Subnetting:
    - Efficiency: Optimizes the network by breaking it into smaller parts.
    - Security: Allows separation of sensitive data (e.g., employees vs. public users).
    - Control: Provides greater control over how devices communicate.
  - Key Questions:
    - What’s the term for dividing a network? Subnetting
    - How many bits are in a subnet mask? 32
    - What’s the range of an octet in a subnet mask? 0-255
    - What address identifies the start of a network? Network Address
    - What address identifies devices within a network? Host Address
    - What identifies the device sending data to another network? Default Gateway

##### The Arp protocol
  - What is ARP?
    - ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) maps an IP address to a device’s MAC address (its physical identifier).
    - Each device keeps a log, called the ARP cache, which stores the IP-to-MAC address mappings of other devices on the network.

  - How ARP Works:
    - ARP Request: A device sends a broadcast message asking, "Who has this IP address?"
    - ARP Reply: The device with that IP address responds with its MAC address.

  - Key Points:
    - ARP allows devices to communicate by linking IP addresses with MAC addresses.
    - The device stores the mapping in its ARP cache for future use.

  - Key Questions:
    - What does ARP stand for? Address Resolution Protocol
    - What ARP packet asks if a device has a specific IP address? Request
    - What is the physical identifier for a device? MAC Address
    - What is the logical identifier for a device? IP Address


  - the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) process between a device and another device on the network:

```
Device A                    Device B
   |                               |
   | ------ ARP Request -------->  |
   |   "Who has 192.168.10.2?"     |
   |                               |
   | <--- ARP Reply (MAC Address)  |
   |   "192.168.10.2 is at xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx"
   |                               |
```

- Explanation:
    1. Device A (which has the IP 192.168.10.1) sends an ARP Request to find the MAC address of Device B with IP 192.168.10.2.
    
    2. Device B responds with an ARP Reply, providing its MAC address (shown as xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx) to Device A.

##### The DHCP Protocol
  - What is DHCP?
    - DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
    - When a device connects to the network, it requests an IP address from a DHCP server.
  
  - DHCP Process:
    - DHCP Discover: The device sends a request to find a DHCP server.
    - DHCP Offer: The DHCP server offers an available IP address.
    - DHCP Request: The device requests the offered IP address.
    - DHCP ACK: The server acknowledges and assigns the IP address to the device.

  - Key Questions:
    - What packet does a device send to retrieve an IP address? DHCP Discover
    - What packet does the device send after being offered an IP address? DHCP Request
    - What is the final packet sent by the server to confirm the IP assignment? DHCP ACK


  - DHCP process

Device                         DHCP Server
   |                                |
   | ------ Discover  -------->     |
   |                                |
   | <------ Offer (192.168.10.1) - |
   |                                |
   | ------ Request (192.168.10.1) >|
   |                                |
   | <------ ACK ---------------    |
   |                                |

This diagram illustrates the standard 4-step DHCP process:

1. Discover: The device sends a broadcast message to find a DHCP server.
2. Offer: The DHCP server replies with an offer of an IP address.
3. Request: The device requests to use the offered IP address.
4. ACK: The DHCP server confirms and assigns the IP address to the device.

##### What is the OSI Model?
  - OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)
    - Purpose: A fundamental framework in networking that dictates how devices send, receive, and 
      interpret data.
    - Benefit: Allows devices with different designs and functions to communicate smoothly across a 
      network by following the same standard.
    - Layers: The OSI model consists of 7 layers (Layer 7 to Layer 1), each with specific 
      responsibilities.
    - Encapsulation: As data travels through the layers, extra information is added at each stage.

  - Key Points:
    - OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection.
    - The model has 7 layers.
    - Encapsulation refers to the process of adding information to data at each layer.
    - This version is short and to the point!

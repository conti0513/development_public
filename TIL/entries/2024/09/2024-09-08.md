### **Setting Up the Google Apps Script**:

1. Open the linked Google Spreadsheet.
2. Go to **Extensions > Apps Script** to open the script editor.
3. In the script editor, add the following code:

```javascript
function autoReply(e) {
  // Check if 'e' object is received
  if (!e || !e.values) {
    Logger.log("Error: No form submission data found.");
    return; // Exit if there's no submission data
  }
  
  var values = e.values;
  Logger.log("Form values: " + JSON.stringify(values));

  // Map form fields
  var companyName = values[1];  // Assuming 1st index is company name
  var name = values[2];         // Assuming 2nd index is name
  var email = values[3];        // Assuming 3rd index is email

  // Log the extracted values
  Logger.log("Extracted - Company Name: " + companyName);
  Logger.log("Extracted - Name: " + name);
  Logger.log("Extracted - Email: " + email);

  // Construct the email content
  var title = `${name}, Thank You for Your Inquiry`;
  var body = `
Dear ${name},

Thank you for your inquiry.
We have received your request with the following details:

Company Name: ${companyName}

Email Address: ${email}

`;

  // Log email content before sending
  Logger.log("Email Subject: " + title);
  Logger.log("Email Body: " + body);

  try {
    // Send the email
    MailApp.sendEmail({
      to: email,
      subject: title,
      body: body
    });
    Logger.log("Email sent to: " + email);
  } catch (error) {
    Logger.log("Error sending email: " + error.toString());
  }
}
```

### **Testing the Script**:

1. **Dashboard**: 
   - Once you've added the code, test it by submitting the form.
   - Check the execution of the script by going to **Executions > "autoReply" > 3-dot menu > Logs** in the Google Apps Script dashboard to view logs.

2. **Send a Test Email**: 
   - Here's a simplified test function to verify that email sending is working:

```javascript
function testSendEmail() {
  var mailTo = "your-email@example.com";  // Replace with your email
  var title = "Test Email";
  var body = "This is a test email.";
  GmailApp.sendEmail(mailTo, title, body);
}
```

Run this function to ensure emails can be sent from your script.

---

### **Set Up Trigger**:

1. Open the Google Apps Script editor.
2. Click the **Triggers** (clock icon) or go to **Edit > Current project’s triggers**.
3. Set up a trigger for the `autoReply` function:
   - **Choose which function to run**: Select `autoReply`.
   - **Select event source**: Choose **From form**.
   - **Select type of event**: Choose **On form submit**.
4. Save the trigger.
5. **Authorize the script** if prompted to allow the script to send emails on form submission.

---

### **Template and Trigger Explanation**:

- **Template Retrieval**: The email content is dynamically constructed based on form submission data.
- **Trigger Explanation**: The script runs automatically whenever the form is submitted, and the trigger ensures that the email is sent in response.

---

### **Final Check**:
1. Fill out the form to test the automatic email reply functionality.
2. Check your inbox for the test email to confirm it was sent successfully.
3. Review the logs in the script editor if any issues arise.

### CI/CD piplines for multiple Python projects using GitHub Actions
Today, I created and tested CI/CD pipelines for multiple Python projects using GitHub Actions. 
Each project has its own Dockerfile and workflow file, 
enabling automated building and pushing of Docker images to Docker Hub.

Here is a summary of today's learning:



### Key Steps

1. Shell Script for Creating Workflows:
    - Created `create_workflow.sh` to generate workflow files for normal builds and rollbacks for each project.

2. Shell Script for Setting Up Workflow Directories:
    - Created `setup_workflow_dirs.sh` to set up the directory structure for GitHub workflows.

3. Generated Workflow Files:
    - Each project now has its own `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` file, ensuring isolated CI/CD processes.


### Example Shell Script

```sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting to create a workflow..."

# Interactive user input
read -p "Enter workflow type (normal/rollback): " workflow_type
read -p "Enter project name (e.g., project1): " project_name

# YAML file path
yaml_file="/workspaces/development_public/infra_pjt/python_projects/${project_name}/.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$yaml_file")"

# Generate YAML content
if [ "$workflow_type" == "normal" ]; then
    cat <<EOL > $yaml_file
name: Build and Push Docker Image for ${project_name}

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'infra_pjt/python_projects/${project_name}/**'

jobs:
  build-and-push-python:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          username: \${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: \${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          context: ./infra_pjt/python_projects/${project_name}
          file: ./infra_pjt/common/Dockerfile
          push: true
          platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
          tags: butainco/${project_name}:latest

EOL
elif [ "$workflow_type" == "rollback" ]; then
    cat <<EOL > $yaml_file
name: Rollback Docker Image for ${project_name}

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  rollback-python:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

      - name: Login to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v1
        with:
          username: \${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: \${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Rollback
        run: |
          docker pull butainco/${project_name}:previous
          docker tag butainco/${project_name}:previous butainco/${project_name}:latest
          docker push butainco/${project_name}:latest

EOL
else
    echo "Invalid workflow type: $workflow_type"
    exit 1
fi

echo "Workflow file created successfully: $yaml_file"
```

### Conclusion

This setup ensures that each project has isolated CI/CD workflows, improving the modularity and maintainability of the development process.


### Each Python Project
/workspaces/development_public/infra_pjt/python_projects/project1/app.py
/workspaces/development_public/infra_pjt/python_projects/project1/requirements.txt

### Common Dockerfile
/workspaces/development_public/infra_pjt/common/Dockerfile

### YAML file path
yaml_file="/workspaces/development_public/infra_pjt/python_projects/${project_name}/.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml"


### Download and Run Docker Image Locally
1. Docker login
docker login

2. Download the Docker Image
docker pull butainco/pproject1:latest

3. Run the Docker Container
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 butainco/project1:latest

4. One Liner
docker login && docker pull butainco/project1:latest && docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 butainco/project1:latest

### Setting Timezone to JST and Synchronizing Time in GitHub Codespaces

Today, I configured the timezone in my GitHub Codespaces environment to Japan Standard Time (JST) and synchronized the system clock. 
Here are the steps I followed:

1. Update the package list and install `ntpdate`:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y ntpdate
    ```

2. Synchronize the system clock with an NTP server:
    ```bash
    sudo ntpdate ntp.ubuntu.com
    ```

3. Set the hardware clock to the current system time:
    ```bash
    sudo hwclock --systohc
    ```

4. Check if the timezone data for `Asia/Tokyo` exists:
    ```bash
    ls /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Tokyo
    ```

5. Change the timezone:
    ```bash
    sudo ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Tokyo /etc/localtime
    ```

6. Verify the current timezone setting:
    ```bash
    date
    ```

After performing these steps, the system timezone was successfully set to JST, and the system clock was synchronized with the correct time.

### Creating a TIL Entry Script

Today, I created a script to automatically generate a new TIL (Today I Learned) entry for the current date in my GitHub Codespaces environment. 
Here are the steps I followed and the script content:

#### Script Content

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Get current date components
current_year=$(date +%Y)
current_month=$(date +%m)
current_date=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Define the directory path
directory="./entries/$current_year/$current_month"

# Create the directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p $directory

# Define the file path
file_path="$directory/$current_date.md"

# Create the file with a sample header if it doesn't already exist
if [ ! -f $file_path ]; then
    echo "# Today I Learned" > $file_path
    echo "" >> $file_path
    echo "## $current_date" >> $file_path
    echo "" >> $file_path
    echo "### Today's Learnings" >> $file_path
    echo "- " >> $file_path
    echo "File $file_path created successfully."
else
    echo "File $file_path already exists."

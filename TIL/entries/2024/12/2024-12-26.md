So in education, a very important part of our lives, basically, then what are the benefits of the use of education?  
How does it help in teaching and learning?

### **Note**

#### **Situation**
A junior high school student gave a presentation at a speech contest in front of a large monitor in a big presentation room.  
The girl had a microphone and a presentation switch to change slides.  
There were many of her friends and teachers listening to and monitoring her speech.  
The subject of her speech was "Technology in Education."

#### **My Impression**  
I am in Japan, over 40years, and during my teenage years, 
there were no technological devices or concepts like today.  

We could only learn from books, teachers, and our parents.  
So, we often went to school and the library to gain new knowledge.  
To access cutting-edge concepts, we had to go to college.

However, today, teenagers and adults use technological devices, software, and services to improve learning.  

It is one of the pros of technology that we can learn anytime, anywhere.

#### **My Understanding**  
I could understand about 50% of her speech, but I missed a few important sentences.

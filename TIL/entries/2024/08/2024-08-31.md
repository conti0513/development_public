###To get started with studying security on your M1 Mac using Kali Linux

To install Kali Linux on my local machine (Apple M1 Mac) via UTM 

#### env
Mac Book Air
Apple M1 Chip
Memory 8GB
macOS sonoma 14.6.1
--


### Step 1: Install UTM (Universal Turing Machine)
UTM is a virtual machine emulator specifically designed for Apple Silicon Macs, making it easier to run different OS environments like Kali Linux.

1. **Download UTM**: Visit [UTM's official website](https://mac.getutm.app/) and download the latest version.
2. **Install UTM**: Once the download is complete, open the `.dmg` file and drag UTM to your Applications folder.
3. **Open UTM**: Launch UTM from your Applications folder.

### Step 2: Download Kali Linux ARM64 ISO
Since your Mac uses an ARM processor, you need the ARM version of Kali Linux.

1. **Visit the Kali Linux Download Page**: Go to the [Kali Linux official download page](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-arm).

2. **Select the ARM64 Image**: Choose the appropriate ARM64 image for your environment. You'll likely need the "Kali Linux RaspberryPi ARM64" image, as it's the closest match for ARM architecture.

3. **Download the Image**: Download the `.iso` file.

### Step 3: Set Up Kali Linux in UTM
1. **Create a New Virtual Machine**:
   - Open UTM and click on the `+` button to create a new VM.
   - Select `Virtualize` since you're running an ARM64 system.
   - Choose `Linux` as the operating system.
   
2. **Configure the VM**:

    Virtualization Engine:Use Apple Virtualization
    *Important:
      If you choose another option, you may encounter complications with the display settings.

    Boot ISO Image:Select the ISO image you just downloaded
      kali-linux-2021.2-installer-arm64.iso

   - System: Allocate resources (CPU, memory) according to your needs
     Hardware 
       Memory:default
       CPU   :default
       Strage size 64gb:default
       Shared Directory:default
      
       note  :2 CPU cores and 4GB RAM is a good start.

     Summary
       name : Give your VM a name like "Kali Linux.(as you like)"   

3. **Install Kali Linux**:
   - Start the VM, and it should boot from the ISO.
   - Follow the installation prompts within Kali Linux to set up your environment.
   - Be sure to set up your user account and password during installation.

   Note
     Partition disks(Choose bellow option)
      - Guided - use entire disk
      - Select disk to partition: Virtual disk 1 (vda) - 68.7 GB Virtio Block Device
        If you choose another option, you may encounter complications
        with the partition settings.
      - Selecting for partitioning:
        Partition scheme:
          All files in one partition(recommended for new users)
       
       
### Step 4: Set Up Your Security Environment
1. **Update and Upgrade Kali Linux**:
   After installation, open the terminal in Kali Linux and run:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

   #### if you fail apt update, check following
   curl -I https://www.kali.org
    error

   sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf
     # nameserver ***
     # nameserver ***
     nameserver 8.8.8.8
     nameserver 8.8.8.4
  
   curl -I https://www.kali.org
     200

2. **Install Essential Security Tools**:
   Kali Linux comes pre-installed with many tools, but you might want to add specific ones:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install metasploit-framework nmap wireshark aircrack-ng -y
   ```

3. **Set Up Networking**:
   Ensure your VM has proper network settings to perform tasks like penetration testing, which often requires network connectivity.

4. **Install Additional Tools**:
   Depending on your focus area in security, you may need to install other tools like:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install burpsuite john hydra -y
   ```

### Step 5: Start Learning
- **Practice Penetration Testing**: You can use platforms like Hack The Box or TryHackMe to practice your skills.
- **Follow Tutorials**: There are many resources online for learning how to use the tools in Kali Linux effectively.

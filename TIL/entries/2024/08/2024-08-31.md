## Detail

###To get started with studying security on your M1 Mac using Kali Linux

### Step 1: Install UTM (Universal Turing Machine)
UTM is a virtual machine emulator specifically designed for Apple Silicon Macs, making it easier to run different OS environments like Kali Linux.

1. **Download UTM**: Visit [UTM's official website](https://mac.getutm.app/) and download the latest version.
2. **Install UTM**: Once the download is complete, open the `.dmg` file and drag UTM to your Applications folder.
3. **Open UTM**: Launch UTM from your Applications folder.

### Step 2: Download Kali Linux ARM64 ISO
Since your Mac uses an ARM processor, you need the ARM version of Kali Linux.

1. **Visit the Kali Linux Download Page**: Go to the [Kali Linux official download page](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-arm).

2. **Select the ARM64 Image**: Choose the appropriate ARM64 image for your environment. You'll likely need the "Kali Linux RaspberryPi ARM64" image, as it's the closest match for ARM architecture.

3. **Download the Image**: Download the `.iso` file.

### Step 3: Set Up Kali Linux in UTM
1. **Create a New Virtual Machine**:
   - Open UTM and click on the `+` button to create a new VM.
   - Select `Virtualize` since you're running an ARM64 system.
   - Choose `Linux` as the operating system.
   
2. **Configure the VM**:
   - **Name**: Give your VM a name like "Kali Linux."
   - **System**: Allocate resources (CPU, memory) according to your needs 
   (2 CPU cores and 4GB RAM is a good start).
   - **Drives**: Attach the Kali Linux ISO you downloaded earlier as the boot image.
   - **Network**: Configure networking to use NAT, so your Kali VM can access the internet through your host Mac.

3. **Install Kali Linux**:
   - Start the VM, and it should boot from the ISO.
   - Follow the installation prompts within Kali Linux to set up your environment.
   - Be sure to set up your user account and password during installation.

### Step 4: Set Up Your Security Environment
1. **Update and Upgrade Kali Linux**:
   After installation, open the terminal in Kali Linux and run:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Install Essential Security Tools**:
   Kali Linux comes pre-installed with many tools, but you might want to add specific ones:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install metasploit-framework nmap wireshark aircrack-ng -y
   ```

3. **Set Up Networking**:
   Ensure your VM has proper network settings to perform tasks like penetration testing, which often requires network connectivity.

4. **Install Additional Tools**:
   Depending on your focus area in security, you may need to install other tools like:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install burpsuite john hydra -y
   ```

### Step 5: Start Learning
- **Practice Penetration Testing**: You can use platforms like Hack The Box or TryHackMe to practice your skills.
- **Follow Tutorials**: There are many resources online for learning how to use the tools in Kali Linux effectively.

# 🧩 English Fluency Plan (SC-900 → SC-200 Path)

### 🎯 Goal
Improve **fluency** (not grammar) — enhance *reaction speed* through daily short-form AI dialogue.

| Time | Focus | Method |
|------|--------|--------|
| Morning | Typing drills (café) | Silent reflection × AI dialogue |
| Night | Oral output | Solo talk or AI voice chat |
| Daily | Topic practice | 1 short English reflection |

**Keywords:** implement / ensure / vulnerability / system / network / issue / IP address  
**Goal:** Master security + cloud + English → overseas project participation (2026).

# 🧭 Mode System — SISU / STANDARD / FULL (2025-10-11)

### 🧩 Background
Frequent fluctuation between PJ workload, health, and family required an **adaptive learning mode**.  
So, I systematized personal rhythm into 3 modes — like IaC for life.

| Mode | Context | Purpose | KPI |
|------|----------|----------|------|
| **FULL** | Stable PJ + full energy | Maximize output | 5 TIL / 120 min study |
| **STANDARD** | Balanced week | Maintain rhythm | 3 TIL / 60 min study |
| **SISU** | Fatigue / overload | Recovery & reflection | 1 TIL / 30 min input |

> Sisu = “Quiet regeneration.”  
> Pausing isn’t failure — it’s **rooting for the next phase.**

---

# 🌱 Monthly Reflection — October 2025

## 🪞 Theme
> “Rebuild the system. Root deeply, move calmly.”

---

### 🧭 Overview
October marked the **rebirth of structure and rhythm**.  
AI-assisted reflection + SISU mode = regained balance across work, study, and lifestyle.

---

### 🧩 Key Achievements

| Area | Highlights |
|------|-------------|
| **SISU Systemization** | Mode structure (SISU/STD/FULL) clarified → stable rhythm |
| **GitHub Revival** | Daily commits revived → steady green streak |
| **Financial Flow** | Cash flow stabilized; loan applied successfully |
| **Lifestyle Optimization** | “One-code” wardrobe established → reduced decision fatigue |
| **Mental Stability** | Routine stabilized via SISU journaling |
| **Terraform Development** | Layer 1–2 completed; foundation for Cloud Run deployment ready |

---

### 🧠 Reflection
October wasn’t about speed — it was about **systemic recovery**.  
Each small step was a *root*, not a *leaf*.  
The system is alive again — that alone is success.

---

### 🪶 Commit Message
```

---

### 🧩 Workflow Summary

1. 📥 Admin inputs product info to Spreadsheet (manual or via import)
2. 🛠️ After marking "Repaired ✅", GAS detects update
3. 🛒 GAS sends listing payload to eBay via API
4. 🖼️ Images fetched from Drive → uploaded to eBay
5. 📣 Logs posted to Slack or saved in spreadsheet
6. 🔄 On sale or timeout, item auto-relisted or archived

---

### 💬 Reflections

* ✍️ Only touch "Spreadsheets & Screwdrivers" — everything else flows
* 🧠 Structure beats repetition: **engineer once, profit often**
* 🎯 Ideal for small-scale commerce + solo operations (like “Last Wheel Village”)

# 📘 TIL - 2025-03 Security Engineer’s Highlight

## ✅ Highlight of the Month

🚀 **Secure FTPS Transfer API over Cloud Run with Static IP Architecture**
Cloud Run × FTPS × VPC Networking を活用した、再現性とセキュリティを両立する**クラウドファイル転送基盤**を構築。

> Designed and implemented a stateless, serverless file transfer pipeline using Cloud Run and FTPS (Passive mode), with static IP support via VPC Connector + Cloud NAT.

---

## 🔐 Security Architecture Overview

```
[GCS] ──(trigger)──> [Cloud Run API]
                           │
                 (Static IP via NAT + VPC Connector)
                           │
                 ──> [FTPS Server on GCE]
```

* **Encrypted File Transfer**: FTPS (TLS) ensures in-transit confidentiality.
* **Static Egress IP**: Enables access to legacy servers with IP whitelisting.
* **Passive Mode Configuration**: Port 21 + range 50000–55000 opened explicitly.
* **Least Privilege Scope**: Access limited to specific GCS buckets and FTPS target only.

---

## 🧩 Modular Breakdown

| Module              | Purpose                    | Security Role                         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `A_cloudrun-api/`   | GCS-triggered upload logic | Stateless transfer handler            |
| `B_ftps-server/`    | FTPS with TLS on GCE       | Secure endpoint with logging          |
| `C_vpc-networking/` | VPC Connector + NAT        | Egress IP control, isolation enforced |

---

## 🧠 Security-Centric Learnings

* 🔐 **Cloud Run integration with external FTPS requires static IP control** due to whitelist constraints.
* 🧱 **Passive FTPS mode** introduces complex NAT traversal and firewall design requirements.
* 🧪 Logging and modularization support **traceability and audit-readiness**.
* ⚖️ Entire setup was scripted via **shell and JSON**, no Terraform used—ideal for small, controlled deployments or POC.

---

## 📁 Operational Validation Log

```bash
✅ GCS trigger: file uploaded
✅ Cloud Run fired: function started
✅ FTPS succeeded: secure upload confirmed

Transferred:
upload_test_20250323050140.txt → /home/your_username/...
```

---

## 🧭 Reflection as a Security Engineer

* 各コンポーネントの役割を明確に分離（トリガー／通信／固定IP管理）し、**再利用・監査対応・障害切り分け**に強い設計を実現。
* **実装視点に偏りがちなFTPS通信を、構成設計と通信制御の観点で再評価**。
* コードの一貫性、モジュール化、ドキュメント整備により、**他プロジェクトへの転用性と共有可能性**も確保。

---

## 🔁 Next Steps

* `detection_scenarios/` に「外部FTPS連携」用の検知ルールを記述
* Cloud NAT構成を Terraform 版でも再現予定
* 構成図およびREADMEをセキュリティ視点でリファクタリング
* Slack通知時に転送検知ログを付加するための署名付きWebhookを設計中

## ✅ 3月の最大成果 / Highlight of the Week

🚀 **Cloud Run + FTPS を連携した「サーバーレス・ファイル転送 API」構築に成功！**  
Built a fully automated FTPS transfer API using Cloud Run, supporting static IP and GCS triggers.

---

## 🔧 構成とモジュール / Architecture & Modules

├── A_cloudrun-api/      # Cloud Run API + GCS trigger
├── B_ftps-server/       # FTPS server on GCE
└── C_vpc-networking/    # VPC Connector + NAT for static IP
```

- GCS にファイルをアップロードすると Cloud Run が起動し、FTPS に転送される  
- Static IP を Cloud NAT + VPC Connector で実現  
- FTPS は Passive モードで、Firewall やポートレンジも調整済み

## 🧠 学び・気づき / Learnings & Takeaways

- Cloud Run で外部 FTPS に接続するには固定IP構成が必須  
  → Static IP configuration is required for Cloud Run to access external FTPS  
- VPC Connector + Cloud NAT を組み合わせて構成  
  → Combining VPC Connector and Cloud NAT works well  
- FTPS は Passive モード利用時に Firewall と NAT の設計が鍵  
  → Passive mode FTPS requires careful port and firewall design  
- Terraform を使わなくても、シェルと JSON で再現できた

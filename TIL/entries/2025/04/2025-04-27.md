# 📘 TIL: 2025-04-28 – Preparing for Tomorrow's Quiet Success

---

## ✅ Overview

Today, Boo calmly accepted the importance of rest and family time,  
while quietly **preparing the next small but essential move**.

The work for tomorrow (Mac kitting & email flow check) is now fully outlined,  
ensuring a light but steady achievement day ahead.

---

## 📆 Mini Action Plan for Tomorrow

---

### ① Morning: Environment Check (within 10 minutes)

- Boot up the PC and quickly check for any remaining email delays.
- If all clear, switch immediately to kitting mode.

---

### ② Morning Focus: Kitting Session (Main Task)

- Apply the tuned auto-installer flow prepared with the first device.
- If unexpected issues arise, **stay calm, diagnose, and adjust** — no rush.

---

### ③ Afternoon: Finishing + Help Risk Management

- Complete remaining kitting tasks carefully but efficiently.
- If sudden help requests come in: **Decide quickly if manageable**.
- If not, **communicate clearly** and **protect your main task flow**.

---

## 🧠 Mental Attitude

- **Quietly, but steadily.**
- **Stack up small achievements calmly.**
- **Prioritize cool, composed decisions, especially with unexpected requests.**

# 📘 TIL: 2025-04-27 (Security Focus)

---

## ✅ Organizing the Security Career Path

- A career path toward **Blue Team (Defense/Operations)** is realistic and promising.
- Already engaging in security-related tasks through **TryHackMe** and daily work,  
  → can move forward as "**currently practicing**" rather than "**no experience**."
- Focus areas: **Log analysis, SOC, vulnerability assessments, security operations strengthening**.

---

## ✅ Today's Realization

- Security offers **high-paying, remote-friendly, and globally applicable** opportunities.
- Existing skills in **IT infrastructure, cloud, and scripting** can be leveraged easily.
- Gradual accumulation through **TryHackMe and daily TIL** is enough to reach the goal.

---

## 🎯 Next Actions

- Incorporate **THM Blue Team / Basic Exercises** into TIL (even 15–30 minutes daily).
- Continue **job market research** to develop a sense of "**which projects I can already apply for.**"
- Observe daily tasks through a **security operations lens**.

---

> ✅ Small daily efforts can make **Security Project Debut by Fall** a realistic target!

## ✅ 先月の最大成果 / Highlight of the Week

🚀 **Cloud Run + FTPS を連携した「サーバーレス・ファイル転送 API」構築に成功！**  
Built a fully automated FTPS transfer API using Cloud Run, supporting static IP and GCS triggers.

---

## 🔧 構成とモジュール / Architecture & Modules

```
serverless-ftps-api-public/
├── A_cloudrun-api/      # Cloud Run API + GCS trigger
├── B_ftps-server/       # FTPS server on GCE
└── C_vpc-networking/    # VPC Connector + NAT for static IP
```

- GCS にファイルをアップロードすると Cloud Run が起動し、FTPS に転送される  
- Static IP を Cloud NAT + VPC Connector で実現  
- FTPS は Passive モードで、Firewall やポートレンジも調整済み

---

## 🧪 実行ログ / Execution Log

```bash
$ bash 03_test_cloud_run.sh

✅ ファイルアップロード完了 / File uploaded  
✅ Cloud Run 発火確認 / Triggered  
✅ FTPS サーバーに転送成功 / File transfer succeeded

Transfer completed:
upload_test_20250323050140.txt -> /home/your_username/upload_test_20250323050140.txt
```

---

## 🧠 学び・気づき / Learnings & Takeaways

- Cloud Run で外部 FTPS に接続するには固定IP構成が必須  
  → Static IP configuration is required for Cloud Run to access external FTPS  
- VPC Connector + Cloud NAT を組み合わせて構成  
  → Combining VPC Connector and Cloud NAT works well  
- FTPS は Passive モード利用時に Firewall と NAT の設計が鍵  
  → Passive mode FTPS requires careful port and firewall design  
- Terraform を使わなくても、シェルと JSON で再現できた  
  → Infra setup was reproducible with shell + JSON, no Terraform needed

---

## 📌 その他進捗 / Other Progress

- CloudShell から zip 化して Codespaces に転送・展開完了  
  → Zipped files and moved to Codespaces successfully  
- `.gitignore` を使って段階的にコード公開準備中  
  → Using .gitignore to control staged releases  
- GCP コスト最小化のため検証環境のみ構築  
  → Setup done on a test-only basis to minimize GCP billing

---

## 🔜 次のアクション / Next Steps

- README を GitHub で先行公開予定  
  → Start with README release on GitHub  
- SFTP や他サービス連携にも応用可能か検討  
  → Explore SFTP or other system integration  
- Zennに記事化
  → Turn it into a blog post
- 「クラウド完結 × 運用不要 × 固定IP」構成の事例化  
  → Make this a showcase of “serverless + no ops + fixed IP” architecture

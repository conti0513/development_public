# 📘 TIL - 2025-05-06

## ✅ What I Learned Today

* Completed **Section 02.4 (Malware and Network Attacks)** in the CompTIA Security+ series by Professor Messer.
* Covered **15 videos (#40–#54)**, including topics like:

* *Ransomware, Evil Twin, MITM, Cryptographic Attacks, IOC* and more.
* Logged concise **TIL phrases (EN)** per video for retention.
* Created a structured **日英用語集 (JP–EN Glossary)** for all topics.
* Deepened understanding of attack vectors in **wireless, DNS, and application layers**.

## 🧠 New Insight: ADHD-Friendly Input–Output Loop

* Realized that structured Markdown + audio/video → **stable learning zone**.
* Identified that **looped thinking** is best neutralized by:

  * Gentle language output (memo or TIL)
  * **Micro-rewarding** the brain with “done” states
* Named this pattern the **“Input → Structure → Output” Loop**, effective for sustained attention.

---

## 🔁 Next Steps

* Review and reinforce **attack countermeasures** section in upcoming videos.
* Create **use-case summaries** for tools like ESET, Akamai, and Malion.
* Prepare short summaries of **real-world incidents** for interview readiness.
* Continue shaping the **Security+ → Practical Skill → Portfolio Output** loop.

## 🧩 System Design Memo: Quiet Membership Space (Concept Log)

* In parallel with my Security+ prep, I began outlining a **lightweight, serverless membership system**.
* Goal: create a “quiet digital library” — **non-intrusive, async, secure, and minimal** — to store micro-threads like these TIL logs.
* No noisy feeds. No gamification. Just thoughtful tech and structured text.

### ✨ Core Concept

> **“Slack without chaos. Reddit without noise. Notion without clutter.”**
> A focused, searchable space for personal learning traces.

### 🔧 Design Philosophy

| Element       | Design Intention                                                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✍️ Content    | Thread-only, Markdown-based memos                                 |
| 🔐 Access     | Auth-gated, optionally Stripe-linked                              |
| 🕊️ UX        | Notification-free, mobile-first                                   |
| 🧠 Purpose    | Self-curated knowledge trace, not social network                  |
| 🔄 Cost Model | **No subscription initially**, testing utility and cognitive load |

### 🔭 Long-Term Perspective

* Even without monetization, the system doubles as a **portfolio artifact**:

  * Shows ability to **design Quiet-first UX**
  * Demonstrates use of **Firestore / Stripe / auth / serverless**
  * Reinforces “**structure before scale**” principle

> Not every system needs to sell.
> Some exist to prove you can build with clarity.

🧠 **Takeaway**:
This side project reflects my **B2B-oriented thinking** — create quietly, observe carefully, and use real use-cases as trust-building tools for the future.

## ✅ 3月の最大成果 / Highlight of the Week

🚀 **Cloud Run + FTPS を連携した「サーバーレス・ファイル転送 API」構築に成功！**  
Built a fully automated FTPS transfer API using Cloud Run, supporting static IP and GCS triggers.

---

## 🔧 構成とモジュール / Architecture & Modules

```
serverless-ftps-api-public/
├── A_cloudrun-api/      # Cloud Run API + GCS trigger
├── B_ftps-server/       # FTPS server on GCE
└── C_vpc-networking/    # VPC Connector + NAT for static IP
```

- GCS にファイルをアップロードすると Cloud Run が起動し、FTPS に転送される  
- Static IP を Cloud NAT + VPC Connector で実現  
- FTPS は Passive モードで、Firewall やポートレンジも調整済み

## 🧪 実行ログ / Execution Log

```bash
$ bash 03_test_cloud_run.sh

✅ ファイルアップロード完了 / File uploaded  
✅ Cloud Run 発火確認 / Triggered  
✅ FTPS サーバーに転送成功 / File transfer succeeded

Transfer completed:
upload_test_20250323050140.txt -> /home/your_username/upload_test_20250323050140.txt
```

## 🧠 学び・気づき / Learnings & Takeaways

- Cloud Run で外部 FTPS に接続するには固定IP構成が必須  
  → Static IP configuration is required for Cloud Run to access external FTPS  
- VPC Connector + Cloud NAT を組み合わせて構成  
  → Combining VPC Connector and Cloud NAT works well  
- FTPS は Passive モード利用時に Firewall と NAT の設計が鍵  
  → Passive mode FTPS requires careful port and firewall design  
- Terraform を使わなくても、シェルと JSON で再現できた  
  → Infra setup was reproducible with shell + JSON, no Terraform needed

---

## 📌 その他進捗 / Other Progress

- CloudShell から zip 化して Codespaces に転送・展開完了  
  → Zipped files and moved to Codespaces successfully  
- `.gitignore` を使って段階的にコード公開準備中  
  → Using .gitignore to control staged releases  
- GCP コスト最小化のため検証環境のみ構築  
  → Setup done on a test-only basis to minimize GCP billing

---

## 🔜 次のアクション / Next Steps

- README を GitHub で先行公開予定  
  → Start with README release on GitHub  
- SFTP や他サービス連携にも応用可能か検討  
  → Explore SFTP or other system integration  
- Zennに記事化
  → Turn it into a blog post
- 「クラウド完結 × 運用不要 × 固定IP」構成の事例化  
  → Make this a showcase of “serverless + no ops + fixed IP” architecture

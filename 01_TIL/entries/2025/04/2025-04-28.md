# 📘 TIL: 2025-04-28 – Security Market Research (Quiet Hero Style)

---

## ✅ Today's Theme
- Researching the **current trends in security and infrastructure project markets**.
- Identifying **projects that fit the Quiet Hero style**.

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- There are indeed opportunities in security operations and vulnerability assessment support that allow for **steady and quiet growth**.
- However, **the more attractive the project, the higher the competition** — careful and patient selection is key.
- A significant portion of projects are still "operational maintenance" or "vague management tasks," requiring **sharp filtering skills**.
- Supporting roles in **infrastructure, IT administration, and security operations** align well with Quiet Hero principles for sustainable growth.
- Building **global skills** (e.g., English communication, cloud security expertise) will enable a **reverse-import model** in the future — gaining competitive advantage by bringing global standards back into local markets.

---

## 🎯 Next Actions

- Continue daily practice of **filtering for Quiet Hero-friendly projects**.
- Keep building global technical skills to enhance positioning.
- Focus on **quietly expanding personal market value**, without rushing.

## ✅ 先月の最大成果 / Highlight of the Week

🚀 **Cloud Run + FTPS を連携した「サーバーレス・ファイル転送 API」構築に成功！**  
Built a fully automated FTPS transfer API using Cloud Run, supporting static IP and GCS triggers.

---

## 🔧 構成とモジュール / Architecture & Modules

```
serverless-ftps-api-public/
├── A_cloudrun-api/      # Cloud Run API + GCS trigger
├── B_ftps-server/       # FTPS server on GCE
└── C_vpc-networking/    # VPC Connector + NAT for static IP
```

- GCS にファイルをアップロードすると Cloud Run が起動し、FTPS に転送される  
- Static IP を Cloud NAT + VPC Connector で実現  
- FTPS は Passive モードで、Firewall やポートレンジも調整済み

## 🧪 実行ログ / Execution Log

```bash
$ bash 03_test_cloud_run.sh

✅ ファイルアップロード完了 / File uploaded  
✅ Cloud Run 発火確認 / Triggered  
✅ FTPS サーバーに転送成功 / File transfer succeeded

Transfer completed:

## 🧠 学び・気づき / Learnings & Takeaways

- Cloud Run で外部 FTPS に接続するには固定IP構成が必須  
  → Static IP configuration is required for Cloud Run to access external FTPS  
- VPC Connector + Cloud NAT を組み合わせて構成  
  → Combining VPC Connector and Cloud NAT works well  
- FTPS は Passive モード利用時に Firewall と NAT の設計が鍵  
  → Passive mode FTPS requires careful port and firewall design  
- Terraform を使わなくても、シェルと JSON で再現できた  
  → Infra setup was reproducible with shell + JSON, no Terraform needed

---

## 📌 その他進捗 / Other Progress

- CloudShell から zip 化して Codespaces に転送・展開完了  
  → Zipped files and moved to Codespaces successfully  
- `.gitignore` を使って段階的にコード公開準備中  
  → Using .gitignore to control staged releases  
- GCP コスト最小化のため検証環境のみ構築  
  → Setup done on a test-only basis to minimize GCP billing

---

## 🔜 次のアクション / Next Steps

- README を GitHub で先行公開予定  
  → Start with README release on GitHub  
- SFTP や他サービス連携にも応用可能か検討  
  → Explore SFTP or other system integration  
- Zennに記事化
  → Turn it into a blog post
- 「クラウド完結 × 運用不要 × 固定IP」構成の事例化  
  → Make this a showcase of “serverless + no ops + fixed IP” architecture

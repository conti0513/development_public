# Layer 0 — Foundation Design

## Purpose
Create a **clean and portable Terraform sandbox** that works entirely inside GitHub Codespaces.

## Key Points
- All tests run in `sandbox/`
- Designs live in `design_docs/`
- Scripts automate setup and cleanup
- `.gitignore` keeps commits clean
- Fully rebuildable → safe for learning

## Reflection
Simple, modular, and easy to reset — the foundation for all next layers.

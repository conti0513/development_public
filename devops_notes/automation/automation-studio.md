## 🧱 Production Rules

| Step | Action | Purpose |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | Choose a real business scenario | Stay grounded in operations |
| 2 | Draw architecture before coding | Think structurally |
| 3 | Build a minimal working mock | Prioritize clarity over scale |
| 4 | Document everything | Show thinking, not just output |
| 5 | Publish weekly | Train reflex + gather feedback |

**Perfection = enemy.**  
Half-finished is fine — consistency wins.

## 🧠 Background Philosophy

- Knowledge means nothing until it’s **operational**.  
- Reflex beats theory — both in **English** and **IT**.  
- Quantity creates quality.  
- Every mock = training + marketing + documentation.  
- Even a “failed” project = success if it was built.

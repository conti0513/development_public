How to Use This Effectively for TOEIC Listening Practice

Step 1: Listen Without Reading
    Record these sentences using text-to-speech (TTS) or an app like Speechify.
    Play them without looking at the text to improve listening comprehension.

Step 2: Shadowing Practice
    Repeat after the audio to improve pronunciation & listening speed.
    Focus on intonation, linking sounds, and stress.

Step 3: Dictation Practice
    Listen and write down the sentence from memory.
    Compare your writing with the original sentence.
    Helps with spelling, grammar awareness, and listening accuracy.

Step 4: Expand Your Listening Practice
    Try rewording the sentences slightly while keeping the meaning.
    Example:

# Java × Terraform Training MOC — Design Notes

> Internal concept note (for documentation and reference).  
> A structured idea for integrating Java fundamentals into my current DevOps learning stack.  
> This document reflects the intention to **reconstruct technical foundations** while ensuring flexibility and reproducibility.

---

## 🧭 Context & Purpose
Over the past few years, my projects have frequently shifted, often preventing full-cycle completion.  
To counter this, I decided to **externalize and systematize my learning**, making each phase reproducible even if interrupted.  

This MOC (Mock / Model of Curriculum) is designed to serve multiple purposes:
- **Personal training** for Terraform and Java
- **Portfolio** for professional presentation (and Upwork potential)
- **Educational framework** for future instructor work

Even partial progress will leave a usable artifact — *a self-contained, working MOC*.

## ⚙️ Concept Overview
The structure integrates beginner-level Java training modules (aligned with typical vendor curricula)  
and Terraform-based mock deployments, providing both **learning depth** and **demonstrable outcomes**.

| Module | Theme | Output |
|---------|-------|---------|
| M1 | Java Fundamentals (CLI) | CSV aggregation tool / JUnit |
| M2 | Spring Boot REST API | `/tasks` CRUD / Validation |
| M3 | SQL + DB Integration | Flyway `V1__schema.sql`, `V2__seed.sql` |
| M4 | Terraform IaC | Cloud Run + Cloud SQL (plan/apply) |
| M5 | Quizzes / FAQ | 10 short tests + common issues |

Each module stands alone (≈45–90 min).  
They can function as both **training material** and **portfolio assets**.

## ⏳ Execution Framework
- Flexible, interruption-tolerant.
- Progress tracked via simple `STATUS.md` note:
```

Next: Implement /tasks POST error handling.

```
- Weekly rhythm:
- Mon: Define one deliverable
- Tue–Thu: Build / polish
- Fri: Update README & capture screenshot
- Sat: Optional mock test
- Sun: Rest or idea review

---

## 🎯 Completion Definition (DoD v0.1)
- REST API runs locally (`/health`, `/tasks`)
- DB init works via Flyway
- Terraform plan succeeds (apply optional)
- README includes 90-sec summary + screenshot

---

## 🧩 Outcomes & Deliverables
- Terraform Associate (TA-003) ready  
- Java Silver SE 11 level verified  
- Working MOC (with documentation & tests)  
- Demonstrable “instructor-level” readiness

---

## 💡 Meta Note
This design allows elasticity — even if the project pauses, the **structure remains**.  
Each piece can be reused or expanded later as:
- Lecture material  
- Training module  
- Technical showcase

> In short: *Rebuilding from first principles, with future reuse in mind.*

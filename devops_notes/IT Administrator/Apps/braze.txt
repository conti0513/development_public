# Fail to create a new user

Case:
    You deleted the email "aaa.bbb@aaa.com" and then tried to create a new user 
    with "aaa.bbb@aaa-web.com," but the creation failed.
    
    Possible causes include:
    1. Email Domain Similarity: Braze may restrict similar email addresses.
    2. Incomplete Deletion: The deleted profile may still exist partially in Braze.
    3. Segmentation Conflicts: The deleted email might still be tied to segments or campaigns.
    4. Blacklisted Email: The email or domain could be blacklisted.
    5. Delay in Deletion: There could be a delay in fully processing the deletion.

Solution:
    1. Verify complete deletion of the old email in Braze’s database.
    2. Check for segmentation or campaign ties to the old email.
    3. Ensure the domain isn't blacklisted in Braze.
    4. Wait for a while and retry creating the new user.
    5. If the issue persists, contact Braze support for further assistance.
    
    This approach should help resolve the issue.



Steps to Verify Deletion from Braze Dashboard:
    1. Log into Braze:
        Navigate to your Braze dashboard using your administrator credentials.
        Go to the "User Search" Section:

    2. In the left-hand menu, go to "User Management" or "User Lookup".
        You may also find it under "Segments" or "Users" depending on your setup.
        Search for the Deleted Email:

    3. Use the search bar to enter the old email address ("aaa.bbb@aaa.com") and search for any existing user profiles.
        If the profile still exists, you’ll see the associated user details.
        Check for the User’s Presence:

    4. If the profile appears in the search results, it means the user has not been fully deleted.
        In this case, delete the user manually by selecting the profile and using the delete option (if applicable).
        Check Segments and Campaigns:

    5. If no user is found, check if the email is still tied to any segments or campaigns.
        Go to the "Segments" section, search for any segments or lists that may still contain the old email, and remove it from any active segments or campaigns.
        Confirm Deletion:

    6. Once the old email no longer appears in the search results or any segment lists, it’s fully deleted from the system.
        After confirming the complete deletion, try creating the new user with the new email address.

Summary

Issue:
You attempted to create a new user with the email address aaa.bbb@aaa-web.com, but the action failed due to the user ID needing to be unique across Braze environments. It’s likely that this email already exists in another Braze environment.
Solution:
This issue cannot be resolved from the user side alone and requires assistance from Braze Support. The following steps are suggested for resolution:

Explain the Problem:

Inform Braze Support that you encountered an error when trying to create a user with the email aaa.bbb@aaa-web.com. Explain that the user ID conflict may be due to the email already existing in another environment, triggering Braze’s unique user ID limitation.
Request Support’s Help:

Ask Braze Support to investigate whether the email aaa.bbb@aaa-web.com is registered in another environment and causing the issue.
Request guidance on either removing the existing user or allowing you to create a new user with the same email.
Provide Relevant Information:

Give the support team the email address (aaa.bbb@aaa-web.com) and error message details (“Action failed”) to help them diagnose the issue faster.
Include details about any other environments where the email might be in use.
By contacting Braze Support, they can assist with identifying where the conflict is occurring and provide a solution, such as deleting the conflicting user or allowing the new account creation.

This approach ensures that the user ID conflict is properly resolved.

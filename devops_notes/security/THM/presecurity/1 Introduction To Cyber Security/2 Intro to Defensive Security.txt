# Introduction to Defensive Security

## Defensive Security:
  - Focuses on preventing intrusions and detecting/responding when they happen.
  - Blue Teams specialize in defensive security.

## Key Tasks:
  - User cybersecurity awareness: Training users to avoid attacks.
  - Documenting and managing assets: Keeping track of systems and devices.
  - Updating and patching: Protecting systems against known vulnerabilities.
  - Preventative security: Using firewalls and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) to block attacks.
  - Logging and monitoring: Detecting intrusions and monitoring network activity.

## In this room, you'll learn about:
  - Security Operations Center (SOC)
  - Threat Intelligence
  - Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)
  - Malware Analysis

## Key Question:
  - Which team focuses on defensive security? Blue Team



# Areas of Defensive Security

## Defensive Security Areas:
  1. Security Operations Center (SOC):
    - A team that monitors networks and systems to detect vulnerabilities, policy violations, and intrusions.
    - They handle threat intelligence, gathering information on potential attackers and preparing defenses.

  2. Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR):
    - Digital Forensics: Investigating digital crimes by analyzing files, system memory, logs, and network traffic to find evidence of an attack.
    - Incident Response: Handling cyber attacks by following a 4-step process: 
      Preparation, Detection and Analysis, Containment, Eradication, and Recovery, and Post-Incident Activity.

  3. Malware Analysis:
    - Static analysis: Inspecting malware without running it.
    - Dynamic analysis: Running malware in a controlled environment to observe its behavior.

## Types of Malware:
    - Virus: Spreads by altering or deleting files.
    - Trojan Horse: Disguises as a useful program but hides malicious functions.
    - Ransomware: Encrypts files and demands payment to unlock them.

## Key Questions:
    - What team monitors a network for malicious events? Security Operations Center
    - What does DFIR stand for? Digital Forensics and Incident Response
    - Which malware requires payment to regain access to files? Ransomware


# SOC and SEIM

## Security Operations Center (SOC):
  - As part of the SOC for a bank, you use a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to monitor security events.
  - A SIEM collects data from various sources and detects potential security incidents, such as:
    - Failed login attempts.
    - Logins from unusual locations.
    - Unusual behavior (e.g., a user logging in at odd hours).

## Your Task:
  1. Monitor events in real-time using the SIEM.
  2. Identify suspicious events flagged in red.
  3. Investigate the cause (local user, computer, or remote IP address).
  4. Confirm if the event is malicious and take action (e.g., report the event or block the IP address).

##### What is the OSI Model?
  - OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)
    - Purpose: A fundamental framework in networking that dictates how devices send, receive, and 
      interpret data.
    - Benefit: Allows devices with different designs and functions to communicate smoothly across a 
      network by following the same standard.
    - Layers: The OSI model consists of 7 layers (Layer 7 to Layer 1), each with specific 
      responsibilities.
    - Encapsulation: As data travels through the layers, extra information is added at each stage.

  - Key Points:
    - OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection.
    - The model has 7 layers.
    - Encapsulation refers to the process of adding information to data at each layer.
    - This version is short and to the point!

  - OSI 7 Layer
+-----------------------+
| Application  (Layer 7) |  Interface (Facilitates user interaction with the network)
+-----------------------+
| Presentation (Layer 6) |  Translator (Data formatting and encryption)
+-----------------------+
| Session      (Layer 5) |  Control (Manages and maintains communication sessions)
+-----------------------+
| Transport    (Layer 4) |  Reliable delivery (TCP/UDP, error recovery)
+-----------------------+
| Network      (Layer 3) |  Routing (IP addresses, path determination)
+-----------------------+
| Data Link    (Layer 2) |  MAC addresses, frames (Error detection)
+-----------------------+
| Physical     (Layer 1) |  Physical media (Cables, signals)
+-----------------------+

##### Layer 7: Application Layer
  - Purpose: The layer where users interact with data through protocols and rules.
  - Common Applications: Email clients, web browsers, and file servers like FileZilla.
  - Protocols: Includes DNS (translates website names to IP addresses).
  - Key Points:
   - This layer is called the Application layer.
   - The software users interact with is called a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

##### Layer 6: Presentation Layer
  - Purpose: Translates data between the application layer and the network. 
    Handles data encoding, encryption, and compression.
  - Example: SSL/TLS encryption used in secure web browsing.
  - Key Points:
    - Translates data and ensures it's in a readable format.
    - Manages encryption and compression.

##### Layer 5: Session Layer
  - Purpose: Manages communication sessions between devices, establishing, maintaining, 
    and terminating connections.
  - Example: Login sessions for applications like remote desktop or websites.
  - Key Points:
    - Controls and manages connections between devices.
    - Starts and ends communication sessions.

##### Layer 4: Transport Layer
  - Purpose: Ensures reliable data transfer using protocols like TCP (reliable) 
    and UDP (fast but unreliable).
  - Example: TCP for web browsing, UDP for streaming video.
  - Key Points:
    - Ensures reliable delivery of data.
    - Uses protocols like TCP and UDP.

##### Layer 3: Network Layer
  - Purpose: Manages routing and forwarding of data based on IP addresses.
  - Example: Routers sending data across networks using IP.
  - Key Points:
    - Routes data based on IP addresses.
    - Operates at the IP level.

##### Layer 2: Data Link Layer
  - Purpose: Transfers data between devices on the same network. 
    Uses MAC addresses for communication within a local area network (LAN).
  - Example: Ethernet, Wi-Fi.
  - Key Points:
    - Transfers data using MAC addresses.
    - Works within the same network.

##### Layer 1: Physical Layer
  - Purpose: Deals with the physical connection between devices, like cables and hardware.
  - Example: Ethernet cables, fiber optics, and network interface cards.
  - Key Points:
    - Manages the physical transmission of data (signals, cables, etc.).
    - Focuses on hardware and connection media.

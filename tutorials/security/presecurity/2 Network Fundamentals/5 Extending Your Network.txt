#### Introduction to Port Forwarding
  - Port forwarding allows applications and services to connect to the internet from within a private network.
  - Without port forwarding, services (e.g., web servers) are only accessible within the local network.
  - The router opens specific ports to allow external devices to access internal services.

#### Firewalls 101

**Concepts**
  - Stateful Firewall:
    - Inspects the entire connection, not just individual packets.
    - Makes dynamic decisions based on connection behavior.
    - Uses more resources than stateless firewalls.
    - Can block an entire device if the connection is bad.

  - Stateless Firewall:
    - Uses static rules to evaluate each packet separately.
    - Less resource-intensive, but less intelligent.
    - Only effective as the rules defined in it.
    - Good for handling large traffic (e.g., DDoS attacks).

  - Firewalls work at Layer 3 (Network) and Layer 4 (Transport).


#### VPN Basics

 - Benefits of VPN
    Connects geographically distant networks:
      Allows businesses with multiple offices to share resources (e.g., servers) across locations.

    Offers privacy:
      Encrypts data, making it unreadable to anyone except the sender and recipient.
      Useful in public Wi-Fi environments to prevent data sniffing.

    Provides anonymity:
      journalists and activists rely on VPNs in countries with restricted freedom of speech.
      VPNs hide your traffic from ISPs and intermediaries, but privacy depends on whether the VPN logs user data.

 - VPN Technologies
    PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol):
      Used for authentication and encryption (like SSH keys).
      Not routable on its own (cannot leave the network without help).

    PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol):
      Enables PPP data to travel between networks.
      Easy to set up but offers weaker encryption.

    IPSec (Internet Protocol Security):
      Encrypts data using the IP framework.
      More difficult to set up but provides strong encryption and wide device support.



#### LAN Networking Devices

  Router:
    - A **router** connects networks and directs data between them (**routing**).
    - Operates at **Layer 3** of the OSI model.
    - Decides paths based on factors like shortest, most reliable, or fastest routes.
    - Configurable for tasks like port forwarding and firewalling.

  Switch:
    - A **switch** connects multiple devices within a network. 
    - **Layer 2 switches** forward data using MAC addresses.
    - **Layer 3 switches** can route packets like a router using IP addresses.
    - **VLANs** separate devices virtually for added security.

  Key Terms:
    - **Routing**: Action done by a router.
    - **Layers**: Switches work at **Layer 2** and **Layer 3**.

### Windows Fundamentals 3

#### Windows Updates
- Access Windows Update via Run dialog or Command Prompt:
  - Command: `control /name Microsoft.WindowsUpdate`

#### Windows Security

- **Virus & Threat Protection**
- **Firewall & Network Protection**
  - Command to open Windows Defender Firewall: `WF.msc`

- **App & Browser Control**

  - **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**: A secure crypto-processor providing hardware-based security functions.

**BitLocker**
- BitLocker is a Microsoft-developed feature for data protection, securing data from theft or exposure.
  - **Encrypts entire drives**: Protects sensitive information by encrypting hard drives.
  - **TPM Integration**: Provides optimal security with TPM (a hardware component in many computers).
  - **Unauthorized access protection**: Ensures data is inaccessible without proper decryption.

- **For computers without TPM**:
  - Insert a **USB startup key** for BitLocker access.

### Task 1: Introduction
- Microsoft’s Active Directory (AD) helps manage users and devices in a company. Key parts include:
  - **What AD Is**: Manages and authenticates users and resources.
  - **AD Domain**: Registers users and devices for control.
  - **AD Components**: Includes domain controllers, groups, and policies.
  - **Forests and Trusts**: Connects multiple domains securely.

---

### Task 2: Windows Domain
- Imagine managing a small network with five computers manually. However, scaling to hundreds of computers and users makes manual management impractical.

- **Windows Domain**: Groups users and computers under one system using AD for centralized management, with a Domain Controller (DC) running AD services.

**Key Benefits**:
  - **Centralized User Management**: Simplifies user management across the network.
  - **Security Policies**: Configures policies in AD, applied across the network.

**Answers**:
- **Central repository for credentials**: Active Directory
- **Server running AD services**: Domain Controller

---

### Task 3: Active Directory
- **AD Domain Service (AD DS)** is the main component, cataloging "objects" like users, machines, and printers.

**Key Objects**:
- **Users**: Represent people or services and can access resources on the network.
- **Machines**: Every domain-joined computer has a machine account (e.g., `TOM-PC$`).
- **Security Groups**: Manage permissions, include users and machines, and set resource access.

**Key Groups**:
- **Domain Admins**: Full control of the domain.
- **Server Operators**: Manage Domain Controllers.
- **Backup Operators**: Access all files for backups.
- **Domain Users/Computers**: All domain users and computers.

**Organizational Units (OUs)**: Organize users and computers by department (e.g., IT, Marketing), used for applying policies. Security Groups control access, while OUs apply configurations.

**Answers**:
- **Administers all resources**: Domain Admins
- **Machine account for TOM-PC**: `TOM-PC$`
- **Policy application container**: Organizational Units

### Task 4: AD Organizational Unit (OU) Management and Delegation

#### Objective
Update the AD structure per the organizational chart.

1. **Deleting Extra OUs and Users**:
   - Remove outdated OUs.
   - Enable **Advanced Features** in the View menu.
   - Go to **Properties > Object Tab** to uncheck "Protect from accidental deletion."

2. **Updating Users**:
   - Add or remove users within each department as needed.

3. **Delegating Control**:
   - Delegation allows non-admin users to perform tasks like password resets.
   - Delegate password reset control for Sales, Marketing, and Management OUs to Phillip in IT support:
     - Right-click the Sales OU > **Delegate Control** > select Phillip > grant password reset permissions.
     - Use PowerShell for password resets:
       ```powershell
       Set-ADAccountPassword sophie -Reset -NewPassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt 'New Password')
       Set-ADUser -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true -Identity sophie
       ```

**Answers**:
- **Flag on Sophie’s desktop**: `THM{thanks_for_contacting_support}`
- **Process of granting privileges**: Delegation

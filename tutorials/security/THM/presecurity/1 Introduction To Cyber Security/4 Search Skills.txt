#### Search Engines

  - Summary: Search Engines and Advanced Search Operators
    Every Internet user has used a search engine, but not everyone utilizes its full potential. Most search engines, like Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, offer advanced search operators that help refine and target searches more effectively. Below are some key operators supported by Google:

    1 "exact phrase": Using double quotes around a phrase ensures that the search results contain that exact phrase.
    Example: "passive reconnaissance" retrieves pages with this exact term.

    2 site:: Limits the search to a specific domain.
    Example: site:tryhackme.com success stories only shows results from the TryHackMe website.

    3 - (minus sign): Excludes specific words from the search results.
    Example: pyramids -tourism filters out results that include the word "tourism."

    4 filetype:: Searches for specific file types such as PDFs, DOCs, PPTs, and XLS files.
    Example: filetype:ppt cyber security will find PowerPoint presentations related to cyber security.

    For more advanced search techniques, you can explore the list of search operators supported by your preferred search engine.

#### Specialized Search Engines
  - While general Internet search engines are common, specialized search engines are designed to find specific types of results. Here are some examples:

  - Shodan:
    - A search engine for devices connected to the Internet, such as servers, routers, and IoT devices.
    - Useful for finding specific types and versions of servers and observing their distribution globally.
    - Example: Searching for apache 2.4.1 shows servers running that version and where they are located.
    - Additional Features: Shodan trends for historical data (subscription required).
  
  - Censys:
    - Similar to Shodan but focuses more on Internet-connected hosts, websites, certificates, and other Internet assets.
    - Use cases include enumerating domains, auditing open ports/services, and discovering rogue assets.
    - Useful for deeper insights into Internet infrastructure.
  
  - VirusTotal:
    - An online virus-scanning service that checks files or URLs against multiple antivirus engines.
    - Users can upload files, provide URLs, or enter file hashes to see if they have been flagged by antivirus programs.
    - Community comments help explain flagged files and can provide more context if a detection might be a false positive.
  
  - Have I Been Pwned (HIBP):
    - A service that checks if an email address has appeared in any data breaches.
    - Alerts users if their information (especially passwords) has been exposed in a breach.
    Highlights the risks of using the same password across multiple platforms.

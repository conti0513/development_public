## What is Networking?
  - What is a Network?
    - A network is simply a collection of things that are connected.
    - In computing, networks link devices like phones, laptops, cameras, and even traffic lights.
    - Networks are everywhere in daily life, helping to gather data, deliver services, and manage systems.
  - Key Question:
    - What is the term for devices that are connected together? Network

## What is the internet?
  - What is the Internet?
    - The Internet is a giant network made up of many smaller networks.
    - Think of it like Alice introducing new friends (Zayn and Toby) to her current friends (Bob and Jim), forming a new, larger network where Alice acts as the messenger.
 
  - History of the Internet:
    - The first version of the Internet started with the ARPANET project in the late 1960s.
    - In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (WWW), allowing the Internet to become a place for storing and sharing information.

  - Key Points:
    - Private networks are small networks.
    - Public networks connect private networks together, forming the Internet.

  - Key Question:
    - Who invented the World Wide Web? Tim Berners-Lee

## Indentifying Devices on a Network

  - IP Addresses & MAC Addresses
    - IP Address: A unique address used to identify a device on a network. It can be public (used on the internet) or private (used within a local network).
      - An IP address is divided into 4 sections called octets.
      - Two versions: IPv4 (4.29 billion addresses) and IPv6 (340 trillion+ addresses), with IPv6 designed to solve the shortage of IPv4 addresses.

    - MAC Address: A unique identifier assigned to a deviceâ€™s network interface by the manufacturer. It's made of 12 hexadecimal characters and cannot be changed, but it can be spoofed to impersonate another device.

    - Spoofing: When a device pretends to have the MAC address of another device, often breaking security measures.

  - Key Questions:
    - What does IP stand for? : Internet Protocol
    - What is each section of an IP address called? : Octet
    - How many sections does an IP address have? : 4
    - What does MAC stand for? : Media Access Control

## Ping(ICMP)
  - What is Ping?
    - Ping is a fundamental network tool that checks if a connection between devices exists and how reliable it is.
    - It uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to send echo packets and receive echo replies from the target device.
    - Ping measures the time it takes for packets to travel between devices.

  - How to Use Ping:
    - The command is: ping [IP address or website URL].
    - Example: ping 192.168.1.254 sends packets and measures how long they take to return.

  - Key Questions:
    - What protocol does ping use? ICMP
    - What is the syntax to ping 10.10.10.10? ping 10.10.10.10

### Script
Today I am enthusiastic about sharing my research, my favorite research, which is about the use of technologies.
In education, researchers have proven that ICT, which is Information and Communication Technologies, is to facilitate learning. So the role of ICT is to ease learning.

So let's imagine tomorrow's education. How do you feel what tomorrow's education would look like? Think about it.

Right now, I'm going to share with you a piece of video that might be the future of education. While we are looking at it, please make a comparison with today's education in your mind.

Let's watch.

Thank you.

### Situation
Dr. Shirin Shafiei Ebrahimi is speaking in front of a big monitor at TED.
She is talking about her favorite research on how to improve ICT in education.
Her English is very simple and easy to understand for non-native audiences because it is clear and slow.
I am looking forward to resuming the speech.

### My Impression
This video was uploaded six years ago, and I have watched the first 1.5 minutes.
Her research is still very relevant today.
She predicted the current situation.
ICT has facilitated education, especially after the pandemic, as almost everything has been supported and enhanced by ICT.

### **Note**

#### **Situation**
A junior high school student gave a presentation at a speech contest in front of a large monitor in a big presentation room.  
The girl had a microphone and a presentation switch to change slides.  
There were many of her friends and teachers listening to and monitoring her speech.  
The subject of her speech was "Technology in Education."

#### **My Impression**  
I am in Japan, over 40years, and during my teenage years, 
there were no technological devices or concepts like today.  

We could only learn from books, teachers, and our parents.  
So, we often went to school and the library to gain new knowledge.  
To access cutting-edge concepts, we had to go to college.

However, today, teenagers and adults use technological devices, software, and services to improve learning.  

It is one of the pros of technology that we can learn anytime, anywhere.

#### **My Understanding**  
I could understand about 50% of her speech, but I missed a few important sentences.

#### Second minutes:Introdusing new and modern technological devices.
It is introducing new and modern technological devices such as interactive whiteboards, digital cameras, vendor projectors you see in every single classroom, and numerous educational software to the classroom.

There are totally a lot of computer applications that enhance learning, some of which you might find familiar. These include online learning software such as Google Meet and Zoom.
Then there's classroom management software such as Schoology, Google Classroom, etc.
Student information system software includes Wisenet, Workday, and so on.

We all know that teaching is actually hard work.
Correcting tests and assignments by hand takes a lot of time and energy.
This is why teachers could really use a helping hand from technology because technology is a useful tool that makes teaching an easier job.

Using technological tools, teachers will not have to worry about taking too much time to grade papers or prepare for lessons.

# Fail to create a new user

Case:
    You deleted the email "aaa.bbb@aaa.com" and then tried to create a new user 
    with "aaa.bbb@aaa-web.com," but the creation failed.
    
    Possible causes include:
    1. Email Domain Similarity: Braze may restrict similar email addresses.
    2. Incomplete Deletion: The deleted profile may still exist partially in Braze.
    3. Segmentation Conflicts: The deleted email might still be tied to segments or campaigns.
    4. Blacklisted Email: The email or domain could be blacklisted.
    5. Delay in Deletion: There could be a delay in fully processing the deletion.

Solution:
    1. Verify complete deletion of the old email in Braze’s database.
    2. Check for segmentation or campaign ties to the old email.
    3. Ensure the domain isn't blacklisted in Braze.
    4. Wait for a while and retry creating the new user.
    5. If the issue persists, contact Braze support for further assistance.
    
    This approach should help resolve the issue.



Steps to Verify Deletion from Braze Dashboard:
    1. Log into Braze:
        Navigate to your Braze dashboard using your administrator credentials.
        Go to the "User Search" Section:

    2. In the left-hand menu, go to "User Management" or "User Lookup".
        You may also find it under "Segments" or "Users" depending on your setup.
        Search for the Deleted Email:

    3. Use the search bar to enter the old email address ("aaa.bbb@aaa.com") and search for any existing user profiles.
        If the profile still exists, you’ll see the associated user details.
        Check for the User’s Presence:

    4. If the profile appears in the search results, it means the user has not been fully deleted.
        In this case, delete the user manually by selecting the profile and using the delete option (if applicable).
        Check Segments and Campaigns:

    5. If no user is found, check if the email is still tied to any segments or campaigns.
        Go to the "Segments" section, search for any segments or lists that may still contain the old email, and remove it from any active segments or campaigns.
        Confirm Deletion:

    6. Once the old email no longer appears in the search results or any segment lists, it’s fully deleted from the system.
        After confirming the complete deletion, try creating the new user with the new email address.

*# 🔹 7. Inversions
Negative Adverb Inversion – Never have I seen such dedication.
Conditional Inversion – Should you need help, let me know.
Hypothetical Inversion – Had I known, I would have helped.

    🔹 Inversions（倒置）簡単まとめ 🚀
    英語の 通常の語順 は [主語 + 動詞] ですが、
    強調したり、フォーマルな表現にするために 倒置（Inversion） を使います。

    Inversions (倒置) - Quick Summary
    1️⃣ Negative Adverb Inversion（否定副詞の倒置）
    → 否定副詞 (Never, Rarely, Little, Hardly, Seldom, Scarcely) を文頭に置くと、主語と助動詞が倒置される。

    ✅ Never have I seen such dedication.
    （こんなに熱意のある人は一度も見たことがない。）

    ✅ Rarely do we get such an opportunity.
    （こんなチャンスはめったにない。）

    📌 注意点： ❌ Never I have seen…（誤り ❌）
    ✔ Never have I seen…（正しい ✔）

    2️⃣ Conditional Inversion（条件の倒置）
    → If を使わずに、Should, Were, Had を文頭にして倒置を作ることで、よりフォーマルな条件文にする。

    ✅ Should you need help, let me know.
    （もし助けが必要なら、教えてください。）
    = If you should need help, let me know.

    ✅ Were I you, I wouldn’t do that.
    （もし私があなたなら、そんなことはしない。）
    = If I were you, I wouldn’t do that.

    ✅ Had I known, I would have helped.
    （もし知っていたなら、手伝ったのに。）
    = If I had known, I would have helped.

    📌 構造ルール：

    Should + 主語 + 動詞（原形）, 主節
    Were + 主語, 主節
    Had + 主語 + 過去分詞, 主節
    3️⃣ Hypothetical Inversion（仮定法の倒置）
    → 「If I had」を「Had I」に倒置 すると、よりフォーマルで強調された表現になる。（過去に起こらなかったことの仮定）

    ✅ Had I studied harder, I would have passed the exam.
    （もっと勉強していたら、試験に合格していたのに。）

    = If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.

    💡 まとめ： ✔ 否定副詞（Never, Rarely など）が文頭に来ると倒置が発生！
    ✔ If を使わずに「Should, Were, Had」で条件文が作れる！
    ✔ 仮定法過去完了「If I had ～」を「Had I ～」に倒置できる！

# Today I Learned

## 2024-08-12

### Today's Learnings

- Modified GitHub Actions workflow:
  `/workspaces/development_public/.github/workflows/experience2_terraform_apply.yml`

- Updated Terraform `main.tf`:
  `/workspaces/development_public/terraform/main.tf`

- Tested launching an EC2 instance via Terraform on the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

### Test Results

**What Worked Well:**
- Successfully launched an EC2 instance using Terraform via GitHub Actions.
- Allowed SSH access from all IP addresses (this poses a security risk).
- Successfully connected to the EC2 instance via SSH.

**What Didn't Work:**
- Limiting SSH inbound traffic to Codespaces IP for security purposes (using `curl`) didn't work as planned.
- Fetching the IP address using `fetch.sh` didn’t succeed when called from `main.tf`, even though it worked independently.
- Challenges encountered with using `vars.tf` for IP address management.
